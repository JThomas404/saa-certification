### **Lesson 11-20: Multi-Account Organizations, Networking, and High Availability**
- Creating multi-account AWS organizations, implementing service control policies (SCP), and configuring VPC, subnets, and routing.
- Implementing Cross-Region Replication (CRR), CloudWatch alarms, and securing data with encryption.

### **Lesson 21-30: Application Deployment, Storage, and Automation**
- Deploying EC2 instances, configuring storage (EBS, S3, and EFS), and automating setups with CloudFormation.
- Installing WordPress on EC2, containerizing applications with Docker, and deploying with Fargate.

### **Lesson 31-40: Monitoring, Security, Backup, and Scaling**
- Configuring CloudWatch for monitoring logs and metrics, implementing failover routing, and working with RDS and backup strategies.
- Scaling applications with CloudFront, load balancers, and ensuring security with encryption and access controls.

### **Lesson 41-50: Advanced Topics and Real-World Applications**
- Leveraging CloudFront, implementing cross-region solutions, integrating Amazon Macie for data security, and optimizing application deployment strategies.
