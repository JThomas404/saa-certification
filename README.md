## About This Project

The **AWS Solutions Architect - Associate** certification validates your ability to design and implement distributed systems on AWS. The goal of this project is to document all the steps, from setting up AWS environments to deploying applications, while learning how AWS works in real-world scenarios.

This repository contains:
- Hands-on labs and exercises from the AWS Solutions Architect course.
- Sample configurations, scripts, and AWS services configurations.
- Challenges I faced and how I solved them.
- Insights and best practices that I gathered along the way.
- Documentation of important AWS services, architectures, and design patterns.

## Learning Path

This certification preparation consists of multiple stages. The lessons span across key AWS services and architecture best practices:

- **Lesson 1**: Basics of IAM, multi-factor authentication, and securing AWS accounts.
- **Lesson 2-10**: Core AWS services such as EC2, S3, CloudFormation, and IAM management.
- **Lesson 11-20**: Setting up multi-account organizations, VPCs, networking, and high availability.
- **Lesson 21-30**: Application deployment strategies, working with EC2 instances, RDS, and other AWS resources.
- **Lesson 31-40**: Advanced topics like encryption, CloudWatch monitoring, and scaling services.

Each lesson includes detailed explanations, code samples, and configuration files where applicable. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of AWS services and how they can be combined to build scalable, secure systems.

## Challenges Faced

While going through the lessons, I encountered a few challenges:
- **IAM Policy Confusion**: Initially, I had trouble understanding the difference between managed and inline IAM policies. After hands-on practice and reviewing documentation, I gained a clearer understanding of their differences and best practices.
- **CloudFormation Templates**: Converting manual setups to CloudFormation scripts was challenging due to the verbosity and learning the syntax. With practice, I became more comfortable using CloudFormation for automated infrastructure deployment.
- **VPC Networking**: Setting up a multi-tier VPC architecture was complex, but it was crucial for understanding how AWS handles networking and security. Troubleshooting issues related to routing, NAT Gateways, and VPC Peering was invaluable in enhancing my overall networking skills.

## Key Technologies and AWS Services Covered

This certification journey touches on various essential AWS services and technologies:

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: User and role management, policies, MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Instance provisioning, SSH access, scaling, load balancing.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage, bucket policies, static websites.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Networking, subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, security groups.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Relational databases, backups, migrations, multi-AZ deployments.
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code, stack management, automated provisioning.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring, alarms, logging, performance metrics.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)**: Scalable file storage solutions for web applications and multi-instance environments.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Load balancing across EC2 instances for high availability.
