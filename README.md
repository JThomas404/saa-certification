# AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification Journey

This repository documents my journey through the preparation for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)** exam. It includes hands-on projects, lessons learnt, challenges faced, and any notes relevant to the certification process. This repository is intended for personal reference, and I hope it helps others following the same path as well.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a **highly available, scalable WordPress hosting solution** for Animals4Life, a fictional animal welfare organisation. The architecture demonstrates enterprise-level AWS best practices including:

- **Multi-AZ deployment** across 3 availability zones for high availability
- **Auto-scaling web tier** with Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- **Managed database layer** using RDS MySQL with automated backups and Multi-AZ failover
- **Shared file storage** using EFS for WordPress media files across multiple instances
- **Global content delivery** via CloudFront with SSL/TLS termination
- **Infrastructure automation** using CloudFormation templates for reproducible deployments

## About This Project

The **AWS Solutions Architect - Associate** certification validates your ability to design and implement distributed systems on AWS. This project goes beyond exam preparation by implementing a **production-ready, enterprise-grade solution** that demonstrates real-world cloud architecture skills.

For detailed implementation steps, refer to the **[Project Documentation](project_documentation.md)**.
The **[Challenges](challenges.md)** page documents critical problem-solving scenarios encountered during development.

## Learning Path

This certification preparation consists of multiple stages. The lessons span across key AWS services and architecture best practices:

### **Lesson 1-10: IAM, Security, and Core AWS Services**

- Setting up IAM accounts, and custom roles for access control.
- Exploring EC2, S3, CloudFormation, KMS, and implementing IAM permissions.

### **Lesson 11-20: Multi-Account Organizations, Networking, and High Availability**

- Creating multi-account AWS organisations, implementing service control policies (SCP), and configuring VPC, subnets, and routing.
- Implementing Cross-Region Replication (CRR), CloudWatch alarms, and securing data with encryption.

### **Lesson 21-30: Application Deployment, Storage, and Automation**

- Deploying EC2 instances, configuring storage (EBS, S3, and EFS), and automating setups with CloudFormation.
- Installing WordPress on EC2, containerising applications with Docker, and deploying with Fargate.

### **Lesson 31-40: Monitoring, Security, Backup, and Scaling**

- Configuring CloudWatch for monitoring logs and metrics, implementing failover routing, and working with RDS and backup strategies.
- Scaling applications with CloudFront, load balancers, and ensuring security with encryption and access controls.

### **Lesson 41-50: Advanced Topics and Real-World Applications**

- Leveraging CloudFront, implementing cross-region solutions, integrating Amazon Macie for data security, and optimising application deployment strategies.
- Using Athena for querying real-world data applications.
