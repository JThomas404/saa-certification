# AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification Journey

This repository documents my journey through the preparation for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)** exam. It includes hands-on projects, lessons learned, challenges faced, and any notes relevant to the certification process. This repository is intended for personal reference, and I hope it helps others following the same path as well.

## About This Project

The AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification validates your ability to design and implement distributed systems on AWS. The goal of this project is to document all the steps, from setting up AWS environments to deploying applications, while learning how AWS works in real-world scenarios.

This repository contains:
- Hands-on labs and exercises from the AWS Solutions Architect course
- Sample configurations, scripts, and AWS services configurations
- Challenges I faced and how I solved them
- Insights and best practices that I gathered along the way
- Documentation of important AWS services, architectures, and design patterns

## Learning Path

This certification preparation consists of multiple stages:
- **Lesson 1**: Basics of IAM, multi-factor authentication, and securing AWS accounts.
- **Lesson 2-10**: Core AWS services such as EC2, S3, CloudFormation, and IAM management.
- **Lesson 11-20**: Setting up multi-account organizations, VPCs, networking, and high availability.
- **Lesson 21-30**: Application deployment strategies, working with EC2 instances, RDS, and other AWS resources.
- **Lesson 31-40**: Advanced topics like encryption, CloudWatch monitoring, and scaling services.

Each lesson includes detailed explanations, code samples, and configuration files where applicable.

## Challenges Faced

While going through the lessons, I encountered a few challenges:
- **IAM Policy Confusion**: Initially, I had trouble understanding the difference between managed and inline IAM policies. After hands-on practice and reviewing documentation, I gained a clearer understanding.
- **CloudFormation Templates**: Converting manual setups to CloudFormation scripts was challenging due to the verbosity and learning the syntax.
- **VPC Networking**: Setting up a multi-tier VPC architecture was complex, but it was crucial for understanding how AWS handles networking and security.

These challenges have been documented along with the solutions I implemented, and I encourage others to share their experiences or improvements.

## Key Technologies and AWS Services Covered

- **IAM**: User and role management, policies, MFA
- **EC2**: Instance provisioning, SSH access, scaling
- **S3**: Object storage, bucket policies, and static websites
- **VPC**: Networking, subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways
- **RDS**: Relational database services, migration, backups
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code, stack management
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring, logging, and alarms
- **EFS & S3**: File storage solutions, access management

## Hands-On Projects

The repository contains a series of hands-on projects, including but not limited to:
- Setting up a static website with S3
- Automating EC2 instance provisioning with CloudFormation
- Implementing a multi-region S3 replication system
- Creating secure IAM policies for accessing AWS services
